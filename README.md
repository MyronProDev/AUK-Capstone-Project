# Capstone Project

## Description
This repository contains the code, models, and documentation for a capstone project focused on predicting cyclical economic trends in the stock market. Using historical data from 2010 to 2023, the project leverages machine learning and time series forecasting techniques to identify and forecast market cycles, such as bull and bear markets.

## Features
- **Data Collection:** Integration with Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage for historical stock price data and economic indicators.
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of statistical (ARIMA, Prophet), machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost), and deep learning (LSTM, GRU) models.
- **Evaluation:** Performance comparison using RMSE, MAPE, and R-squared metrics.
- **User Interface:** Minimal UI built with Streamlit for data input, model selection, and result visualization.

## Requirements
- **Python:** 3.10
